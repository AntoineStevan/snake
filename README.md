# Neo-snake

## 1. Installation
### a. The game font.
**Neo-snake** uses a special font that allows the terminal to display squares characters.

One can download the *square* font [here](https://strlen.com/square/).

Once the .ttf file in dowloaded, simply move it inside one of the system fonts directory.

On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, such directories are under `/usr/share/fonts`, `/usr/local/share/fonts` or `~/.fonts`. The latter does not require `sudo` rights as it is only local.

### b. Python modules
No particular dependencies (?).

## 2. Run the code.
Run the code by running the `./run` command in the shell.
